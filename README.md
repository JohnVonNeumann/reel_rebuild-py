# Reel 
## Marketplace for fishermen, find guides for local spots.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JohnVonNeumann/reel_rebuild-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JohnVonNeumann/reel_rebuild-py)

This project was originally built in Rails whilst at Coder Academy Melbourne going through my bootcamp. I was never proud of the code I wrote, so I'm taking the time to rebuild it in Python, a language I am now working with in a professional manner. I hope to fix up not only the app and the idea, but also the holes in my knowledge.

### To Use:

Create a Python3.6 virutalenv:
> virtualenv -p python3.6 venv-36-reel

Activate venv:
> source venv-36-reel/bin/activate

Git clone the repo:
> git clone https://github.com/JohnVonNeumann/reel_rebuild-py.git

Install requirements:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Run tests:
> nosetests
